  <div class="title">Development Essay </div>
    <div class="essay">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On my journey to advanced standing thus far I have worked with graphic design, coding, photography, video, sound, and motion graphics. I explored these mediums mostly in my courses at Purchase but have done plenty outside of an academic setting too. What I love about this field is that each course and medium under the umbrella of New Media relates to and facilitates one another. Photography helps with video, video helps with film. Graphic design and photography translates to motion graphics. It’s a beautiful thing.

	<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Prior to joining the New Media program I was interested in graphic design, photography, and film. I explored these passions through a small brand I created with help from a couple friends called GOON or Grown Out of Nothing. I would design clean and simple graphics, mostly for tee shirts and hoodies, inspired by New York iconography and pop culture references from old video games and other sources. Running a brand I was able to apply my interests designing the clothes, silk screen printing, photographing photoshoots, and creating promotional videos and graphics for social media. I learnt so much from the endeavor about what it means to run a business and everything that goes into owning a clothing brand. Specifically, the importance of a team and building a community. Since coming to college, my work on the project has slowed down but my interest in designing clothes and creating content surrounding them has never ceased. If I were to start another clothing brand or revitalize Goon, building a community and team is something I would focus on.
<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
As for my work at Purchase, I have taken two coding classes, Programming for Visual Artists and Intro to the Web. Having had zero prior coding experience to these courses I was pleasantly surprised at how I was able to grasp the concepts, giving me insight into the inner workings of all the programs, video games, and media that I consume and utilize on a regular basis. Although programming is not my cup of tea, I am glad I took the courses and have an understanding of how it all works. I plan on continuing to build and update my portfolio website in my vision, even after graduating from Purchase. I never would have thought I would be doing such a thing but these foundation courses gave me the keys and I’m thankful for it.
<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
I have always been interested in photography but never had a great camera nor put the time into learning the craft. Taking Digital Photography, being able to use good cameras and learning the basics was a dream come true. As I got used to it I learnt that I was able to control so much about a photo by what camera, what lens, what aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focus. So much goes into it and it feels natural at this point. When I’m at school I love to have a camera rented at all times for impromptu photoshoots and various assignments (I’m in Photojournalism right now). I also have an old point and shoot film camera I like to carry around on me for capturing moments and memories, creating art in an instant.
<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
I also really love working with film, video and sound. Video Art 1, Intro to Sound, and Intro to Digital Filmmaking have been some of my most enjoyable. Learning about form and content in film helped me attach words and meanings to some of the ideas I already recognized. Video Art 1 gave me an opportunity to experiment and develop my video editing skills. In both video classes I found myself benefitting immensely from what I learned in Digital Photography, as all the same principles of using a camera remain the same. In Intro to Sound I learnt about the importance of sound design and how it can control, guide, and make or break a piece. The technical skills translated directly to film, for getting good sound recordings and Video Art, for having good sound design.
<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	My Advanced Standing Portfolio is a reflection of most of the work I’ve done up to this point and what I have learnt. I feel as though through producing this body of work I have grown a ton as a mixed media artist.  I’m still deeply interested in graphic design and photography as well as film and video so whatever I do in the future, I see myself incorporating skills and aspects from each one of these mediums.

<div class="title">Academic Study Essay </div>
  <div class="essay">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my remaining couple of years at Purchase I intend to continue building upon the foundational courses that compelled me the most. Something that’s important in the work I create is that I want to inspire positive social change. I would also like to continue with film classes in the minor and experiment with courses which have always interested me but I haven’t yet had the opportunity to learn.

<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI would really like to keep up photo and video art classes because those are two major forms of media which will always be of great interest to me as both a visual and digital artist. I love the freedom that the photo and video courses can provide in regards to what you can do with a camera and the internet. Video editing is something I’m passionate about and video art classes allow me to experiment and flex those muscles. Photography on the other hand focuses on single still images, which I think strengthens my eye for all visual art. Not to mention I love creating images and capturing moments in time.

<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
In order to learn about how I can apply my media skills to activism and social intervention I plan on taking Material Distribution and Tactical Practical. Living in today's world I feel like there are so many problems where it is wrong to not try to do something about at least one of them. As an artist the best thing that I can do is use my art to draw attention to social issues and/or inspire change. By combining sociology, technology, and art, it is possible to make a difference. These seem like the ideal courses to inform myself on how I can mobilize my art into creating a positive social impact.

<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Other than that, I plan on declaring and continuing with the Film Minor since I will have completed the prerequisites by the end of the semester. Film is something that has always enthralled me. Both of my parents work in the film industry, so of course I have had a keen interest since the onset. I absolutely love watching movies and dissecting why I loved them so much. My absolute goal as a filmmaker is recreating the best (and worst) feelings that I get while watching great movies. While NME covers lots of video aspects, some classes concentrated in film specifically would be ideal.

<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
As for my senior project, I am thinking about doing something that combines video, photography, printed media, and graphic design. This could take the shape of a clothing drop that I design and produce along with a video, photoshoot and zine as a campaign. Or, the zine could be the focus along with a video, website, or social media campaign. Whatever I do, it will include aspects of all the media I’m interested in.

<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Ideally this project would also have a socially conscious aspect to it which stands for something, or encourages people to do something. I don’t have any solidified ideas right now but it could be for example, I ethically source and produce clothes that promote sustainability, or it could be that people have to do something like plant a tree for an item in return. Whatever I choose to do, I am sure I will be passionate about everything from the idea and the process to the product and the impact. It will be multifaceted and show off my interdisciplinary media skills that I have built on as a New Media student.
